# public/uploads/ # Do NOT ignore this if you want images to persist on Render.
#                 # If you ignore it, any images uploaded after deployment will be lost on new deploys.
#                 # For a robust solution, you'd use cloud storage like AWS S3 or Cloudinary.
#                 # For now, it's safer to *not* ignore it for local testing if you don't want to lose them after a new deploy.
#                 # However, for a real production app, 'public/uploads' should generally be ignored,
#                 # and you should integrate cloud storage.
